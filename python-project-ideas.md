# Typing Speed Program

### A program to test the user's typing speed.

Display some text for the user to type back in to the program, and measure the time it takes. You can then calculate words and/or characters typed per minute `(wpm / cpm)`

As an extra idea, you can also try to calculate an **accuracy** of the users typing. How many mistakes were made for example, or a percentage accuracy.

# Username/Email/Password Database

### A program to store and manage usernames and passwords. Allow the user to enter and save their login details for different websites/accounts.

This idea could be as complex or not as you would like.

Do you want to store just usernames and emails? Include passwords as well? Do you want the data to be encrypted?
